shorttext: Job Manager streamlines project management and collaboration, with all jobs and workflows transparently managed, controlled, and processed – no matter whether marketing projects, budget releases or purchase orders.

Web to Publish enables the CD compliant design, adaption, and localization of marketing assets, such as advertisements, brochures, business cards, or posters, without using special applications.  

By using Kanban, Gantt, or list views, the user gets a real-time and accurate overview of current jobs, including a complete history and audit trail of changes. Users can create, edit, forward, and close a job. Every job can be directly linked with attachments and provided with all relevant information, such as duration, responsibilities, and sub-jobs. Workflows define process steps and schedules of a job. They can be designed individually and used as “project blueprints”. The integrated BPMN-based workflow modeler also enables the mapping of complex workflows – also graphically. All areas of the Job Manager are administered by a role-based rights management. Job Manager uses a comprehensive role-based rights management system to ensure accountability and security. 

Job Manager enables both the import of job information and the export of jobs as XML files according to filter criteria. Job Manager can be integrated with Web to Publish, Media Pool, Marketing Planner, and Review Manager.
