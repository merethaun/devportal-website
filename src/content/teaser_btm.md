Web-to-Publish enables the CD compliant design, adaption, and localization of marketing assets, such as advertisements, brochures, business cards, or posters, without using special applications.  

Asset templates can be provided centrally by the administrator in INDD or HTML format and then adapted by the user within the framework of predefined rules, depending on the user profile. The customizing of different assets is supported by testing measures and predefined process steps. To further simplify the creation process, the automatic import of assets, as well as the automatic creation of web and print assets in various formats, is possible. 

Web-to-Publish supports Adobe InDesign. Within our BrandMaker marketing stack, it can be integrated with Media Pool, for example, as a data source, and Marketing Planner, Marketing Shop, Job Manager, Marketing Data Hub, and Review Manager.
