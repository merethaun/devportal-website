With BrandMaker Marketing Planner, you gain full visibility and control over all campaigns, financial planning, and performance measurement. It thus provides a comprehensive platform for all stakeholders.  

Marketing planner enables the planning and budgeting of all marketing activities up to single tasks. Planned, targeted, committed, and actual budgets can be set using the desired granularity and currency. Additionally, all relevant information such as content, purchase orders, invoices, KPIs, attachments, and responsible persons, who are automatically informed, can be defined for each element. By integrating formulas, automated calculations, for example, target/actual comparisons, can be carried out. Utilizing templates and filters, reports, and graphical analysis can be generated according to the user's needs. Role-based rights management ensures visibility, as well as the editing of elements.  

Budget data, invoices, etc. can be imported directly into the Marketing Planner. The export of data in different file formats is also possible. Within BrandMaker’s marketing stack, Marketing Planner can be integrated with Media Pool, Web to Publish, and Job Manager.
