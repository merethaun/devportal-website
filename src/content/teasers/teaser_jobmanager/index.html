<p>Job Manager streamlines project management and collaboration, with all jobs and workflows transparently managed, controlled, and processed – no matter whether marketing projects, budget releases or purchase orders.</p>
<p>By using Kanban, Gantt, or list views, the user gets a real-time and accurate overview of current jobs, including a complete history and audit trail of changes. Users can create, edit, forward, and close a job. Every job can be directly linked with attachments and provided with all relevant information, such as duration, responsibilities, and sub-jobs. Workflows define process steps and schedules of a job. They can be designed individually and used as “project blueprints”. The integrated BPMN-based workflow modeler also enables the mapping of complex workflows – also graphically. All areas of the Job Manager are administered by a role-based rights management. Job Manager uses a comprehensive role-based rights management system to ensure accountability and security.</p>
<p>Job Manager enables both the import of job information and the export of jobs as XML files according to filter criteria. Job Manager can be integrated with Web-to-Publish, Media Pool, Marketing Planner, and Review Manager.</p>
