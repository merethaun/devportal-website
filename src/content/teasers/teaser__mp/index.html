<p>Media Pool delivers a central place to store and manage digital assets in any format, for any device, and for any purpose.</p>
<p>Diverse assets, such as files, videos, and images, can be imported, viewed, downloaded, shared, and deleted by the user. The management of assets enables versioning, tagging, grouping, and editing of asset properties. With the help of the integrated search function, individual, and preconfigured search queries can be carried out, which additionally utilizes AI-based image tagging. Digital rights give internal and external team members role-based access to your digital library. Additionally, version and license management ensure the use of only current and valid content.</p>
<p>Media Pool can be used in conjunction with other BrandMaker modules for example as a repository for the Brand Management Portal or creating content organized in the Marketing Planner. It can also be integrated with Marketing Data Hub, Job Manager, Reporting Center, and Marketing Shop.</p>
